   Re:  MOTHERBOARD PRICES.....
David,
I have dealt with you in the past (I bought my current system components
from you), and I was wondering if you could tell me what the current
going rate is for 486's (No Cyrix chips please...I prefer AMD, Intel,
and possibly IBM). I am interested in the DX variety from 33-100Mhz. I
will be looking to replace my trusty old 386DX-40 sometime in the near
future.
Thanks,
--David

   Re:  B5 INTERNET CONVERSATION
Hello All B5 Fans:
On the Internet is a group that is frequented by one of the
executive producers and writers of the show.  Richmond Connection
 provides access to this group.  The initials of the guy is JMS.  Many
quesitons are raised and answered by him this way.  Apparently over
 next few new shows many things are going to go up in smoke.  Also
apparenly a few of the shows characters will be turned upside down
or inside out so to speak.  So don't miss them...

I had heard the Paramount copied DS9 after B5. The story goes that
Bennett presented the B5 story to Paramount and the company said "A

Well a few months later, guess what? DS9 is born. Very strange.....

   Re:  (R)TIE
Tell ya what. You give mine a try, I will give yours a try. (I'll
probably give it a try anyway.) I have not gotten any feedback about my
TOD. It's here on the BRE as IMPBECN1.ZIP. Try it out. I used XMB302 so
I could edit the briefing maps and it looks like LucasArts put it out
(just because all the map symbols and labels are now there.) The file is
not actually new. I wrote and uploaded it here as IMPBECN.ZIP last may
and I just now re-uploaded it with the improved briefing files. The
story line has to do with the Rebels discovering a technology that
allows them to cloak Rebel ships as Imperial ships. The Empire also
forms its own technology and soon you are up against your own type of
starfighters. One of the missions even has you up against a Calamari
Cruiser in an X-Wing. Mine has hex edited everything as well. The yellow
scrolling text, the mission descriptions at the tour desk, and the green
historical combat mission descriptions. Let me know what you think.

   Re:  TIE
Well im VERY familiar with XMB100.zip the original X-wing tour
editor... i made a tour along time ago... the plot was that the
rebels started to Capture Star Destroyers and use them against
the empire. the scrolling text at the begining of the tour and
the breifings were all done, some of which had to be done in
HEX editing.. one of my favorite things... well you can Download
REBEL.zip here on the BRE... the name wasnt very imaginitive but
thats not too important... all the missions work, after creating
one i flew it to test it.. BTW these are ALL NEW none are just
'fixed' versions of the original tour 1 like the NIP mobs set.
Also it replaces tour 1 and is reliant on the modified .doc's
and .bat files from the heir to the empire set. its pretty
neat.. someone try it and let me know... BTW it backs up your
old .brf and .xwi and has an UN-install .bat

   Re:  (R)TIE
BTW, to ammend my last message, there IS an editor which will allow you
to fly any ship in any of the missions, but this is as far as they have
come. (I forget who wrote it but it wasn't Mr. Westfall) If you can FTP
you can find it at ftp.wpi.edu under the directory starwars/TIE_Fighter.
The filename is TME2.ZIP. If you don't know how to FTP, write me back.
If you don't have internet access or FTP access, I'll ask Webb to upload
it here at the BRE.

   Re:  (R)TIE
BH>Was there ever a TIE editor that really edited the missions?
No, but I have been in touch with Neal Westfall, the creator of the
great X-Wing editor, XMB, and he is in the midst of it right now. Since
he is still working, he can't give me a projected release date, but I
would guess it will be finished around March. If his TIE editor is as
good as his X-Wing editor, this will really be something to look forward
to. In the meantime, if you haven't learned his X-Wing editor, download
it and play with it a while. LucasArts fashioned the TIE missions in
much the same way they did the X-Wing missions (I wouldn't be surprised
if LucasArts used the same mission-construction code.) and things will
be a lot easier to understand when the TIE editor rolls around. I had a
great time with his last XMB editor, XMB302.ZIP (here on the BRE) and I
created a Tour of Duty for X-Wing which I just finished a couple of days
ago. It will be on the BRE soon as IMPBECN1.ZIP. Give it a try if you're
interested.
      Waiting patiently,

all confused with the lettering, I saw somewhere where in undiscovered
it was B. I dont know. Someone clear this up for me! Anyway, I think teh
best ship design inside and out was the enterpise ncc-1701, the one from
star trek II. Coooool. I agree that the enterprise was really dark on
the inside, it did look kinda wierd. A Green Photon Torpedo? Never seen
them before. Oh, yea, the special effects were really good. Ya know why?
Cause ILM did them. When the saucer section did its frisbe thing, some

Is it just me or is no one else bothered about what they did to Data? I
mean, this just destroyes the whole character, does it not? I'm not all
that knowledgeable about ST:TNG (I only started paying attention in the
last season) but I have seen enough to know that the whole driving force
behind this character is that he is trying to come to grips with human
emotion. I think giving him an emotion chip really kills the whole idea.
It's too easy. If they are smart they will rip it out of his head for
the next movie and leave him with the memory of emotion so he can try to
work up from there like he was doing in ST:TNG. Just my $0.02. Otherwise
this is a great movie.

   Re:  (R)GENERATIONS
Come on now,
    DS9 you have to admit has to be much better this season, than any of
the previous seasons. No it's not as good as ST-TNG, but you would have
to admit that the show is getting better. I just thought I would put my
2 cents in, just in case you have blown the series off from last season.

   Re:  GENERATIONS
I thought Gen. was great! The special affects were the best I've seen.
Where did you hear about the class of the new ship? They said that the
story line of the last episode was only one possible future for the
1701D.
 After seeing the movie it reminds me how bad DS9 is, really a poor
substitute for Star Trek!!!!

   Re:  OUTDOORS

Well, I,m glad to see that this sub-board was finally created.  First
I'd like to thank Webb for creating it for us to enjoy.  Second, summer
is almost here and that means it's fishing season.  So is there anyone
out there who enjoys fishing as much as I do.  Let's chat!  What's your
favorite place to go fishing and what for.  A lot of ideas can be
discussed on this sub-board if there are real outdoorsmen who like to
talk to others and share their ideas too.  So if anyone out there knows
of some good fishin' holes, share them.  Also how about hikers and
campers, please all of you share your thoughts with others and let's
make this sub-board one that people can truely enjoy.  Thank you all!
